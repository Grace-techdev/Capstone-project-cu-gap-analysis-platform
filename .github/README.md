### Overview
A reproducible, cross-platform workflow for validating deep-learning (DL) imputed geological datasets against original assays. The system couples a modular Python backend with an interactive Streamlit dashboard so a domain experts (e.g., geoscientists) can use as a decision making tools to inspect records, aggregate grids/voxels, compute statistics, and observe clustering patterns and insights.
